# üîç Cybersecurity Internship ‚Äì Task 1  
**Topic:** Local Network Port Scanning & Analysis  

---

##  Objective  
Learn to discover open ports on devices in the local network to understand network exposure and potential security risks.

---

## Tools Used  
- **Nmap** ‚Äì for network scanning, host discovery, and port enumeration.  
- **Wireshark** *(optional)* ‚Äì for capturing and analyzing network packets in real time.

## Task 1 Summary  

- Performed **network reconnaissance** on my local network to understand potential exposure.  
- Used **Nmap** to scan the local IP and successfully identified four open ports:  
  - **22/tcp ‚Äì SSH**  
  - **80/tcp ‚Äì HTTP**  
  - **3000/tcp ‚Äì PPP**  
  - **7777/tcp ‚Äì CBT**  
- Learned the **services running on each port** and their potential security implications.  
- Optionally used **Wireshark** to capture and analyze real-time **network traffic**, observing how devices communicate on the network.  
- Gained hands-on experience in:  
  - Discovering **active hosts** and **open ports** on a network  
  - Understanding **potential attack surfaces** created by open ports  
  - Observing **packet flow** and network behavior  
- Improved knowledge of **network security best practices**, including:  
  - Closing unnecessary ports  
  - Using **firewalls** effectively  
  - Regular monitoring of network activity to reduce risk  
- **Overall:** This task provided **practical exposure** to cybersecurity tools and techniques, strengthening skills needed for network auditing and protection.  
## üìù Task 2 Summary  
Task 2 focuses on **Phishing attacks**, a common social engineering technique where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords, bank details, or credit card numbers. The task explains how phishing works, highlights the characteristics of phishing emails (such as suspicious email addresses, poor grammar, and fake offers), and provides examples of fraudulent emails like `HramazOn@gmail.com` and `hrflipkart123@gmail.com`. The main goal of this task is to raise awareness, help identify phishing attempts, and recommend security measures such as verifying sender details, avoiding suspicious links, and using multi-factor authentication.

## üß† Key Learnings  
- **Definition of Phishing:** Understanding phishing as a social engineering attack.  
- **How Phishing Works:** Explaining the mechanism and psychological tricks used by attackers.  
- **Red Flags in Phishing Emails:**  
  - Suspicious email addresses (e.g., `HramazOn@gmail.com`, `hrflipkart123@gmail.com`).  
  - Poor spelling and grammar.  
  - Unexpected requests for login credentials or financial data.  
  - Too-good-to-be-true offers or prizes.  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations  
- **Do not click** on links or attachments from unknown senders.  
- **Verify email addresses** before taking any action.  
- Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for extra security.  
- Keep your **antivirus software updated** to block malicious links.  

---

## üéØ Objective  
To raise awareness about phishing attacks and teach how to detect and prevent them.
